There are many websites on the internet for web developers but today I am going to show you some of my favorite and the best websites for the developers.

Let's get startedüî•

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Theodinproject

This is my personal favourite website in terms of learning web development. The Odin Project is open source and is the best for beginners or those who have tried other resources without success, who want to work as a web developer, do freelancing work, build a startup or learn to build a website. This site surely helps you to gain knowledge as it provides some great projects. The Odin project is more of a directory for learning than a real class. It tries to find and organize the best free resources around the net into an easy-to-follow curriculum for learning web development.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ DEV Community

I consider my self very lucky that I have found this awesome dev-community website. Here one can read, write and explore the content and it is a great source for learning new things from different developers out there across the globe. So, this very useful website for all the developers.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ CSS-tricks

Definitely check out this website because you can get lots of tweaks and tricks about the cascading style sheet(CSS). There are a whole bunch of articles, videos and books are available on their site. This is a great learning platform but its prerequisite is that one should atleast have the basic knowledge of CSS as it's better suited to someone who has already been introduced to CSS and is looking for more info on a specific topic or wants to discover new concepts.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ 30secondsofcode

This website provides short code snippets for all your development needs and makes work easier in very less time. You can search by name, tag, language or using a snippet's description. It has Over 400+ code snippets. Just start typing a term and see what comes up. Click on each snippet card to view the whole snippet including code, explanation and examples. You can also use the button on the right side of a snippet card to copy the code to the clipboard.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Frontendmentor

Frontend Mentor is a must for those who are looking to practice and enhance their frontend skills. You'll get cool challenges to improve your skills. It's not only a great resource to learn real-life development skills but also to connect and network with other developers from around the world and to reviews your code and give meaningful feedback. The community is helpful and resourceful. There are lots of projects where you can showcase your talent by participating in many challenges and improve your development skills.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Codemyui

This website is very simple and it provides some awesome snippets which you can use in your projects. CodeMyUI is a really cool repository for CSS snippets, HTML elements and Javascript snippets. All the sections categorize with different UI designs and contain all bunch of different web elements and snippets.

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Shortcuts

Shortcuts.design is a small website that lists every shortcut a designer ever wants to know, all design apps in one place, and in a simple and clear way. It's very useful for new designers to quickly charge their workflow, when you switched to a new design tool or when you just want a reference for repeating actions! I use this website very frequent as it eases my workflow and I recommend you all to give a glance to this site.

# Let's end here
